# complex_exponentials
Presentation source code for AISNSW Mathematics Heads of Department Conference on complex exponentials.

# Abstract
Complex Numbers make up a core study of the Mathematics Extension II course. One of the newest and notable additions to the new syllabus is the Euler Formula of a Complex Number, which opens up discussion about Complex valued functions that were not otherwise possible in the old syllabus.

In the workshop, participants will firstly revisit the concepts of De Moivre's Theorem and Roots of Unity after which the implications of Euler's Formula with regard to Complex Exponentials and Complex Logarithms will be explored. Implications include evaluating complex exponentials, solving complex exponential equations and complex trigonometric equations, amongst many others.

Syllabus Content Outcomes Addressed: MEX-N1.3, MEX-N2.1
